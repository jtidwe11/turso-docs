title: Turso Reference (Swift)
---

The libSQL Rust crate contains everything you need to work with Turso and works flawlessly with popular async runtimes like `tokio`.

## Installing

First begin by adding `libsql` as a package dependency in XCode using this repo:
<https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-swift>

Or add it to your SwiftPM dependencies:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    // ...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql-swift", from: "0.1.0"),
    ],
    // ...
)
```

## Initializing

Make sure add the crate to your project at the top of your file:

```rust
use libsql::Builder;

let url = env::var("LIBSQL_URL").expect("LIBSQL_URL must be set");
let token = env::var("LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN").unwrap_or_default();

let mut db = Builder::new_remote_replica("local.db", &url, &token).build().await.unwrap();
let conn = db.connect().unwrap();
```

## In-Memory Databases

libSQL supports connecting to [in-memory databases](https://www.sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html) for cases where you don't require persistence:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = Libsql.Database(":memory:")
let conn = try db.connect()
```

## Local Development

You can work locally using an SQLite file using `new_local`:

```swift
import Libsql

let db = Libsql.Database("local.db")
let conn = try db.connect()
```

## Embedded Replicas

You can work with embedded replicas using `new_remote_replica` that can sync from the remote URL and delegate writes to the remote primary database:

```swift
import Libsql;

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

### Manual Sync

The `sync` function allows you to sync manually the local database with the remote counterpart:

```rust
try db.sync() // Call sync manually to update local database
```

<Info>

If you require full control over how frames get from your instance of `sqld` (libSQL Server), you can do this using `new_local_replica` and `sync_frames`. Reach out to us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/turso) if you want to learn more.

</Info>

### Sync Interval

The `sync_interval` function allows you to set an interval for automatic synchronization of the database in the background:

```swift
import Libsql;

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>,
    sync_interval: 300 // Sync every 5 minutes
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

### Read Your Own Writes

The `read_your_writes` function configures the database connection to ensure that writes are immediately visible to subsequent read operations initiated by the same connection. This is **enabled by default**, and is particularly important in distributed systems to ensure consistency from the perspective of the writing process.

You can disable this behavior by passing `false` to the function:

```swift
import Libsql;

let db = try Libsql.Database(
    path: "./local.db",
    url: <LIBSQL_URL>,
    authToken: <LIBSQL_AUTH_TOKEN>,
    read_your_writes: 300 // Sync every 5 minutes
)

let conn = try db.connect()
```

## Simple query

You can pass a string to `execute()` to invoke a SQL statement, as well as optional arguments:

<CodeGroup>

```rust Query
try conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
```

```rust Arguments
try conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", 1)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Prepared Statements

You can prepare a cached statement using `prepare()` and then execute it with `query()`:

```rust
let stmt = try conn.prepare("SELECT * FROM users")
stmt.query()
```

## Placeholders

libSQL supports the use of positional and named placeholders within SQL statements:

<CodeGroup>

```rust Positional
conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?1", params![1]).await?;
```

<Note>
Named arguments are not supported yet.

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Batch execute and transaction are not supported yet.
